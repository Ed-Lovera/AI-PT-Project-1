# AI Bootcamp Project 1 - 2020 to mid 2023 Los Angeles Crime Dataset

The goal of this project is to determine what factors within Los Angeles can make a person susceptible to being the victim of a violent crime within Los Angeles.
Factors that we will be considering in order to arrive to our conclusion are the following:
- Is there any correlation to the number of violent crimes to non-violent crimes on a month to month basis?
- What impact did the Covid-19 Stay-At-Home mandate have on violent crimes?
- Which areas of Los Angeles expirience the most violent crimes?
- In the most violent areas, how does time and age factor the likelyhood of being a violent crime victim?

To generate the plots required to answer the questions above, you must exexute the following [notebook](https://github.com/Ed-Lovera/AI-PT-Project-1/blob/main/la_crimes.ipynb).
